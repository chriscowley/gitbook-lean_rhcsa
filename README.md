Lean RHCSA
==========

This book aims to help you get everything you need to obtain your RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) certificate. It is intended both for people just starting out with Linux, or maybe an experienced user who need to fill in the gaps ready for the exam.

Ihere is very little in this exam that cannot be learnt with nothing but a couple of Virtual Machines. The exception is the control of Virtual Machines and some of the file system work.

The simplest option is to use Oracle VirtualBox. It is free and works on Windows, Linux and OSX. Having said that, personally I use KVM while on Linux.

If you have access to VMware, then brilliant, but not all the free options are suitable.ESXi would require extra hardware so many not work for you, and VMware Player only allows you to run a single VM, it will be fine for some stuff, but not others.

You do not really need a subscription to RHEL. Red Hat are one of the best Open Source companies out there. Not only do they publish the source code, they publish it all as packages that make building your own RHEL relatively trivial. The two main projects that do this are [CentOS](www.centos.org) and [Scientific Linux](https://www.scientificlinux.org/). Of the two I tend towards CentOS, not for any particular reason, I just do. Make your choice, but there is no real need to stick with it.
